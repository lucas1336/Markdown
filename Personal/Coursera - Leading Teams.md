# Team Structures

Apollo 13 case study. 7th manned mission to land on moon faced a crisis were they had to get together and adapt to find a way to get back to earth safely.
Important case were an [interview](http://www.c-span.org/video/?c4569094) was made towards lead flight director Jean and he talks about how he managed roles and responsabilities in order to organize the team, how they adapted roles both formal and informal to approach this creative problem solving task in order to be successfull.

## Formal

### Departmentation

The grouping of your teams. How will they be grouped, by function, geography, product, customer segment?

#### Generalist or specialist approach.

Depending on the task environment you find yourself in, one of these approaches will suit you better.

- Specialist structures enable teams to perform much more effectively in predictable task environments because efficiency is the key to success here. Tasks being routine or predictable.

- When the task at hand is dynamic, meaning your faced with a complex problem or or challenge that is new, the teams that have a higher performance are the ones that are more generalist, since it requieres more collaboration and for team members to draw on the expertise of others.

### Centralization

The concept focuses on the distribution of decision making authority. Would decisiones be allocated to a single team member of distributed among many witch would decentralize that authority.
Both are good practices but it will ultimately depend on the environment you are currently working on.

In studies in general, teams that have the leadership distributed, decentralized, tend to be more successfull as to teams with a more centralized leadership, but you have to be smart about the decision if you want to make that migration because it is not always the case. You have to decide what is it you want in your teams.

Take into account that when switching whether it is from centralized to decentralized or vice versa, will affect negatively, but the impact is less when you switch from centralized to decentralized as opposed to switching from decentralized to centralized.

### Virtuality

Concept being, the degree to witch a team is dispersed geographically or nationally. What percent of your team is co-located in the same office versus distributed virtually across geographies? Pattern of communication is also part of the concept, being a more virtual team if communication is primarily through technology.

|Benefits|Drawbacks|
|---|---|
|Foster exchange of contextual knowledge | Increases coordination complexity|
|Integrates performance while allowing for uniqueness | Reduces identification with the team|
|Develop social cues and clear e-comm norms | Reduces clarity and communication richness|

How to overcome these obstacles?

- Use face to face communication with electronic communication.
- Increase the feedback giving and seeking opportunities.
- Develop clear social cues and norms of how to communicate certain topics.

- Empower the team. In a physical environment, it does not have much of an affect, but in a virtual one, it is key to success.
- Support structures.  Clear and fair reward structures, clear task and roles, consistent information sharing.
- Safe environment. Space where people feel they can safely speak up. Psychologically safe environment.

## Informal

### Team Roles

## Extra Notes

- I have seen throughout the videos that in teams, depending on the one you form part of, you start to grow around a set of norms, or rules you follow. That being the case, whenever a team is being changed from one type of team to another, in most cases those norms do not apply and you are, per say, starting from zero. And these switches do not always have the same impact as switching from A to B as B to A, one normally has a greater impact. Concluding that if you change your teams modality, you risk the performance of the team to go down.
- Positive reinforcement is key.
